  <h3>Farmers Markets in Miami</h3>
    <p>Farmers markets have been increasing in numbers over the years, providing people with healthy and organic alternatives to processed foods at local supermarkets.
	<p>According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the amount of farmers markets increased by 76 percent since 2008. This rise in popularity is mainly due to consumers growing interest in receiving fresh, organic products directly from the farms.</p>
	<p>At farmers markets, customers are able to develop face-to-face relationships with the farmers who grow their foods.
	University of Miami freshman Alli Villane shops at farmers markets because she enjoys the close relations.
	“I like the markets because I know exactly where and from whom the food is coming from,” Villane said.</p>
  <p>Farmers markets cater to people who are looking to buy organic foods, meaning that the produce is not made with any added pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms.</p>
	<p>Hailey Wilson, a freshman at the University of Miami, said that she likes the fact that the foods at farmers markets are fresh.
	“The foods you find at the farmers markets don’t come from packages,” Wilson said. “They also don’t need to be on shelves for long so they don’t need to be processed.”</p>
  <p>According to Local Food South Florida, there are about 25 registered farmers markets in South Florida.
	The Market Company began in 1997, just catering to Miami Beach. Now, The Market Company has farmers markets in 12 locations around Miami from Lincoln Road, to Normandy Village, to Aventura Mall, and there is at least one out of the twelve markets open on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at various times.</p>
	<p>The Market Company Manager Claire Tomlin said that mostly everything is locally grown, but it is hard to make everything locally because of the change in farming seasons in South Florida.
	“If you see tomatoes in the market during the summer, they aren’t local,” Tomlin said. “People would still like to buy tomatoes in the summer time, so our tomatoes are coming from North Florida and South Georgia.”</p>
	<p>The Market Company provides consumers with interesting, out-of-the-ordinary foods like kettle corn, guacamole, empanadas, sushi cupcakes, and ceviche.
  Along with these tasty treats, the company also sells foods like local honey, jam and jellies, baked goods and locally grown organic fruits and vegetables.</p>
  <p>Tomlin appreciates that consumers are becoming more conscious of their consumption of vegetables and making healthier decisions when it comes to foods.
	“People are so tuned into fresh greens and being healthy,” she said. “I really like seeing a lot of fresh greens in the market.”</p>
	<p>Glaser Organic Farms began in 1976 and became one of Miami’s first green markets.
  Stan Glaser, manager of Glaser Organic Farms, spoke of the company’s beginnings.
  “The founders saw lands on the outskirts of Coconut Grove that was laying waste,” Glaser said. “They thought they could make it into a farmers market, which didn’t even exist in Miami at the time.”</p>
  <p>Now, Glaser Organic Farms has a farmers market in Coconut Grove every Saturday from 10am to 7pm.
	Glaser said that the company has a wide variety and specializes in raw, vegan and organic foods.
	“We are like the Sears of farmers markets,” Glaser said.</p>
	<p>Immanuel Tafari, a vendor for Via Vegan, has been selling his vegan dishes at Glaser’s farmers market for four years.
	“This market is in alignment with the thought process I have as a vegan,” Tafari said. “This market pushes organic produce and stresses that stuff has to be vegan.”</p>
	<p>Glaser Organic Farms provides customers with tropical fruits and vegetables, like monstera and mamey, based on their seasonal availability. They also specialize in selling organic grains and beans, nut dairy cheese, butters and milks, and raw pizzas with handmade pestos.</p>
	<p>Like The Market Company, not all of the food at Glaser’s farmers market is grown locally due to the changes in farming seasons, but all of the ingredients used to make the produce are organic and farm-grown.
	Some produce that Glaser Organic Farm grows locally includes eggfruit, arugula, baby carrots, spinach, sunflower sprouts, kale, and beets.</p>
	<p>Glaser also provides consumers with exotic, rare fruits from around the world like durian and jaboticaba.
	The farmers market also features a full salad bar with options of rice, avocado, corn, olive or fruit salads. All of the dressings available for the salads are vegan.</p>
  <p>A fan favorite at the Glaser’s farmers markets is Tuby Balls, which is fruit dipped in chocolate. They have mangos, raspberries, blueberries, and apples all dipped in delicious chocolate to make a great summer snack.
	Glaser said that their market prides themselves on providing great, healthy desserts, especially their fruit-flavored ice cream.
	“Our ice cream is definitely very popular,” he said. “Our vegetarian roll-ups and dairy rolls are popular as well.”</p>

  <h3>Jackie Potts Spotlight</h3>
    <p>Jackie Potts received her master’s degree in journalism from the University of Miami in 1992 and began her professional career working at what she called her dream job, The Miami Herald, for eight years.</p>
	  <p>She covered entertainment and lifestyle pieces, and also wrote a weekly column called “Fashion Unzipped” that featured the latest celebrity fashions.</p>
	  <p>Potts also interviewed famous actors and directors like Samuel L. Jackson and Harrison Ford for the Herald, and worked with TV partner WTVJ-NBC6 to broadcast film reviews.</p>
    <p>She recalled the Herald during presidential elections.
      “You were watching the TVs and the votes being counted, and when the winner is decided, you could actually go downstairs in the newsroom and see them laying out the paper that said who won,” Potts said.</p>
    <p>Some of Potts’ favorite assignments at the Herald came from working the general assignments desk.
      “You never knew what you were going to cover that day,” Potts said. “It was always breaking news, and that could mean anything from a truck rollover to a street fair or a UFO sighting.”</p>
    <p>In 2001, Potts took her writing talents to Los Angeles, and joined the team at Entertainment Tonight.
      Potts was the news and fashion editor for Entertainment Tonight Online. She wrote daily news and celebrity features for www.theinsideronline.com and www.etonline.com.</p>
    <p>Entertainment Tonight required a fast-paced lifestyle and for her to be on the call 24-hours.
      “You get a tip in the newsroom, like Angelina Jolie had her first baby, and everyone jumps up and springs into action,” Potts said. “It’s like everyone’s running around with their hair on fire.”</p>
    <p>She left the fast-life of Entertainment Tonight in 2008 to spend some time as a freelance writer and also a copy editor for LifeScript. 	In 2010, she landed her current position at Market Smiths in Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>Market Smiths is a copywriting agency that provides businesses and digital agencies with website content, blog posts, press releases, brochures, and more.</p>
    <p>Potts said she enjoys having a more flexible schedule at Market Smiths.
      “I can work on it at home or in the evening,” she said. “I don’t have to punch a clock or be on call.”</p>
	  <p>Tsitsi Wakhisi, an Associate Professor at the University of Miami, was one of Potts’ professors during her time at The U.
	     “Jackie always had that fire in her eyes and hunger in her belly,” Wakhisi recalled. “She’s a very good writer, and I think that’s what led to her success in her career.”</p>
    <p>Some of Potts’ favorite moments of her career have come from interviewing people like Tim Gun, the cast of Scrubs, and Star Wars characters, and most memorably, the Harry Potter cast.</p>
    <p>An avid Harry Potter fan, Potts was able to travel to the grand opening of the Harry Potter theme park in 2010 as a part of Entertainment Tonight.</p>
    <p>Potts interviewed some of the movies’ biggest stars like Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Dumbledore.
      “It was really a thrill to meet the cast,” Potts said. “It was about as magical as assignments get.”</p>
    <p>Potts even had some time to joke around with the award winning, Harry Potter himself.
      “I had fun teasing Daniel (Radcliffe) that the U.S now had a Hogwarts before England did,” Potts said. “By the end of the evening, he was yelling ‘People of England, we need a Hogwarts!”</p>
